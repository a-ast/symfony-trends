TODO
==============

Beta

0. Define chart colors
0. Output labels with data
0. Improve on hover
0. Improve tooltips
1. Crawl twig and silex
2. Consider the idea to add empty item as a first element of 
   steped area (maybe got it as a special type)
3. add column labels
4. Add column chart symfony vs symfony docs contributors

Architecture:

1. Rethink chart generation: return series list from provider 
   (SeriesProvider)
2. Simplify generator command
2. Merge Highcharts and Highmaps formatters
3. Simplify Formatter (think about serializer)
4. Get rid of categories (always calc it from combination of series)
