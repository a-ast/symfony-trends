TODO
==============

Beta

1. Crawl twig and silex
2. Consider the idea to add empty item as a first element of 
   steped area (maybe got it as a special type)
3. add column labels
4. Add column chart symfony vs symfony docs contributors

Architecture:

1. Rethink chart generation: return series list from provider 
   (SeriesProvider)
2. Simplify generator command
3. Simplify Formatter (think about serializer)
4. Get rid of categories (always calc it from combination of series)


Charts

- People to contributed monthly (most likele showing new contributors)
- Forks by version
- Symfony bundle usage in github
